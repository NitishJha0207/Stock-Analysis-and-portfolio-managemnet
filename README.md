Hence, this gave rise to the dedicated individuals who perform this task on behalf of the investors for a commission - Portfolio managers.
A portfolio manager makes investment decisions and carries out other related activities on behalf of vested investors. They work with a team of analysts and researchers, and their main objective is to realise the needs of the investor and suggest a suitable portfolio that meets all the expectations. They are responsible for establishing the best investment strategy, selecting appropriate investments along with the right allocation. However, in doing so, they face a lot of competition in the form of other portfolio managers and rival firms.
